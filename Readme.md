YOLOv8 License Plate Detection Model
Overview
This project uses the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) object detection framework to detect license plates in images and videos. The model is optimized for real-time detection and can handle various environmental conditions such as different lighting, angles, and backgrounds.

Features
Accurate Detection: Detect license plates with high precision and recall.
Real-Time Processing: Optimized for real-time detection in live video streams.
Flexible Input: Supports image, video, and webcam inputs.
Customizable: Fine-tuned with custom data for improved performance on specific datasets.
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd yolov8-license-plate-detection
Install Dependencies
Install Python dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have the ultralytics library installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install ultralytics
Prepare the Model

Download the pre-trained YOLOv8 weights or train your custom model (instructions below).
Place the model file (.pt) in the weights/ directory.
Usage
1. Detect License Plates in an Image
Run the following command to detect license plates in a single image:

bash
Copy code
python detect.py --source <image_path> --weights weights/best.pt --conf 0.5
2. Detect License Plates in a Video
For video input:

bash
Copy code
python detect.py --source <video_path> --weights weights/best.pt --conf 0.5
3. Real-Time Detection via Webcam
To use your webcam as the input source:

bash
Copy code
python detect.py --source 0 --weights weights/best.pt --conf 0.5
Parameters
--source: Path to the input (image, video, or 0 for webcam).
--weights: Path to the YOLOv8 model weights.
--conf: Confidence threshold for detection (default: 0.5).
Training the Model
To train the YOLOv8 model on a custom license plate dataset:

Prepare your dataset in the YOLO format:

kotlin
Copy code
dataset/
├── images/
│   ├── train/
│   ├── val/
├── labels/
│   ├── train/
│   ├── val/
Edit the data.yaml file:

yaml
Copy code
path: dataset/
train: images/train
val: images/val
nc: 1
names: ['license_plate']
Train the model:

bash
Copy code
yolo train model=yolov8n.pt data=data.yaml epochs=50 imgsz=640
Save the best-performing weights in the weights/ directory.



Customization
Adjust Confidence Threshold: Modify --conf to fine-tune detection sensitivity.
Change Input Size: Use the imgsz argument during training or inference for higher/lower resolution.
